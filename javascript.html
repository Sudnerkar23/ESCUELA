	<p>Why a re-introduction? Because JavaScript is notorious for being misunderstood. It is often derided as being a toy, but beneath its layer of deceptive simplicity, powerful language features await. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.<br><br>

It's useful to start with an overview of the language's history. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language — despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.<br><br>

Several months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet Explorer 3. It was a mostly-compatible JavaScript work-alike. Several months after that, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, a European standards organization, which resulted in the first edition of the ECMAScript standard that year. The standard received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999, and it has stayed pretty much stable ever since. The fourth edition was abandoned, due to political differences concerning language complexity. Many parts of the fourth edition formed the basis for ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009, and for the 6th major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015.<br><br>

Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser, but JavaScript interpreters can also be found in a huge list of other places, including Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, SVG images, Yahoo's Widget engine, server-side environments such as Node.js, NoSQL databases like the open source Apache CouchDB, embedded computers, complete desktop environments like GNOME (one of the most popular GUIs for GNU/Linux operating systems), and others.<br><br>

Overview<br>
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes (see more about prototypical inheritance and ES2015 classes). JavaScript also supports functional programming — because they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed around like any other object.<br><br>

Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:<br>

Number<br>
BigInt<br>
String<br>
Boolean<br>
Function<br>
Object<br><br>
Symbol (new in ES2015)<br>
... oh, and undefined and null, which are ... slightly odd. And Array, which is a special kind of object. And Date and RegExp, which are objects that you get for free. And to be technically accurate, functions are just a special type of object. So the type diagram looks more like this:<br><br>

Number<br>
BigInt<br>
String<br>
Boolean<br>
Symbol (new in ES2015)<br>
Object<br>
Function<br>
Array<br>
Date<br>
RegExp<br><br>
null<br>
undefined<br>
And there are some built-in Error types as well. Things are a lot easier if we stick with the first diagram, however, so we'll discuss the types listed there for now.<br><br>

Numbers<br>
ECMAScript has two built-in numeric types: Number and BigInt.<br><br><br>

The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value (numbers between -(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1). And where this article and other MDN articles refer to “integers”, what’s usually meant is a representation of an integer using a Number value. But because such Number values aren’t real integers, you have to be a little careful.<br><br>

Strings<br>
Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters. This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to deal with internationalization. More accurately, they are sequences of UTF-16 code units; each code unit is represented by a 16-bit number. Each Unicode character is represented by either 1 or 2 code units.<br><br>

If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string consisting of that single character.<br><br>

Other types<br>
JavaScript distinguishes between null, which is a value that indicates a deliberate non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and undefined, which is a value of type undefined that indicates an uninitialized variable — that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet. We'll talk about variables later, but in JavaScript it is possible to declare a variable without assigning a value to it. If you do this, the variable's type is undefined. undefined is actually a constant.<br><br>

JavaScript has a boolean type, with possible values true and false (both of which are keywords.) Any value can be converted to a boolean according to the following rules:<br>

false, 0, empty strings (""), NaN, null, and undefined all become false.<br>
All other values become true.<br>
You can perform this conversion explicitly using the Boolean() function<br><br>

However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this conversion when it expects a boolean, such as in an if statement (see below). For this reason, we sometimes speak of "true values" and "false values," meaning values that become true and false, respectively, when converted to booleans. Alternatively, such values can be called "truthy" and "falsy", respectively.<br><br>

Boolean operations such as && (logical and), || (logical or), and ! (logical not) are supported; see below.<br><br>

Variables<br>
New variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: let, const, or var.<br>

let allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is available from the block it is enclosed in.<br>

Operators<br>
JavaScript's numeric operators are +, -, *, / and % which is the remainder operator (which is the same as modulo.) Values are assigned using =, and there are also compound assignment statements such as += and -=. These extend out to x = x operator y.<br><br>

Control structures<br>
JavaScript has a similar set of control structures to other languages in the C family. Conditional statements are supported by if and else; you can chain them together<br><br>

Objects<br>
JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:<br>

Dictionaries in Python.<br>
Hashes in Perl and Ruby.<br>
Hash tables in C and C++.<br>
HashMaps in Java.<br>
Associative arrays in PHP.<br>
The fact that this data structure is so widely used is a testament to its versatility. Since everything (bar core types) in JavaScript is an object, any JavaScript program naturally involves a great deal of hash table lookups. It's a good thing they're so fast!<br><br>

The "name" part is a JavaScript string, while the value can be any JavaScript value — including more objects. This allows you to build data structures of arbitrary complexity.
